# Thahab_Hub
Live Gold Price Calculator and More.

## Description
Thahab Hub is a mobile application that incorporates features such as a dashboard that displays gold prices in real-time updates, calculates the fair price for selling based on the user's input of number of grams and karat, and gives a suggestion to buy gold jewelry from more than one store. We also included a ring size calculator to help the user find their right size. The user can also know the updated price of gold using the widget, so he or she can know the prices without entering the application.

## UI/UX Case Study
### Project Overview
The goal of this project was to build a mobile application that allows users to Know Today’s Gold price in SAR with other services. The app needed to be user-friendly, easy to navigate, and visually appealing.

### Research
To begin the design process, we conducted research to understand the target audience and their needs. We surveyed potential users and analyzed the competition to gain insights into gold trading apps and their features.

We found that potential users were interested in an app that was easy to use, and provided real-time updates on gold prices.

### Design
Based on our research, we created prototypes to test different design concepts. We focused on creating a simple and intuitive user interface that would allow users to easily navigate the app and use its services.

We incorporated features such as a dashboard that displays real-time gold prices and calculate the fair price for selling based on the user input of number of grams and karat, and the application gives  a suggestion to buy gold jewelry from more than one store . We also included ring size calculator to help user find their right size. 

### Testing
We tested the app with a group of potential users to gather feedback and make improvements. Based on their feedback, we made changes to the user interface to make it even more intuitive and user-friendly.

### Results
Thahab Hub app design was well-received by potential users and our client. Users appreciated the app's simplicity, ease of use, and real-time updates on gold prices. The design also successfully met the client's goal of creating a visually appealing and user-friendly app.
